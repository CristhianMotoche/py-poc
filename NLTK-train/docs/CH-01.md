# Starting with NLTK

NTLK stands for: Natural Language Tool Kit. It is a python library for natural
language processing.

## 'Installing' NLTK data
In the python interpreter:

```python
$ python
...
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
NLTK Downloader
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    d) Download   l) List    u) Update   c) Config   h) Help   q) Quit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Downloader>
```

The previous sentences will help us to install the data required for some future examples.

Now, lets download the `book` collection:

```python
Downloader> d

Download which package (l=list; x=cancel)?
  Identifier> book
    Downloading collection 'book'
       |
       | Downloading package abc to /home/cmotoche/nltk_data...
       |   Unzipping corpora/abc.zip.
       ...
```

Now, lets **load** the book data:

```python
>>> from nltk.book import *
*** Introductory Examples ...
...
>>> text1
<Text: Moby Dick by Herman Melville 1851>
```

## Searching in text
### Concordance
> A concordance view shows us every **occurrence** of a given word, together
with some context.

```python
>>> text1.concordance("monstrous")
Displaying 11 of 11 matches:
ong the former , one was of a most monstrous size . ... This came towards us ,
ON OF THE PSALMS . " Touching that monstrous bulk of the whale or ork we have r

```

A concordance let us see the word in context. We can find out words that are in
the similar contexts by using the `similar` function.

```python
>>> text1.similar("monstrous")
mean part maddens doleful gamesome subtly uncommon careful untoward
exasperate loving passing mouldy christian few true mystifying
imperial modifies contemptible
```

We can also examinate the contexts that are shared by two or more words.

```python
>>> text1.common_contexts(['whale', 'man'])
this_s the_or a_in the_in a_is the_s a_s a_of white_he white_a
the_that the_he a_as a_some the_i a_from a_it the_of the_now the_to
```

## Counting vocabulary
We can use the `len()` function to get the number of words and punctuation marks,
also called **tokens**.

```python
$ len(text1)
```

A **token** is the technical name for a sequence of characters that we want to treat as a group.
